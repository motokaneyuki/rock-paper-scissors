# rock-paper-scissors

## Overview
This is a rock paper scissors game. I tried to make the UI cuter with a cat who is responsive to the game results and made the option to play music for a more immersive game experience.

## How to play

Battle with a cute cat!

Choose from rock, paper, or scissors and click the corresponding button.

First one to get 5 points wins the game.

To play with background music, click the button on the top right corner. Click again to pause.

## What I learned

- How to target nodes with selectors
- How to alter DOM nodes
- Event listeners on buttons
- Event delegation
- How to add, play, pause audio
- How to display and hide pop ups
- Git branch and merge
- and more

## What I want to improve

- Screen size responsiveness
